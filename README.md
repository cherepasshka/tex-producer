## Latex printer for matrix or linear envelope operations
#### Content:
This repository contains the program that produces LaTex code for:
* Printing matrices
* Transforming matrix into stepped matrix form
* Solving matrix equation Ax = b, where b is column
* Solving matrix equation AX = B, where B is matrix
* Findind the fundamental solutions system for linear equation Ax = 0

#### Usage:
Use from command prompt:
```
./main <file>
```
Where \<file\> contains the information about matrix of coeficients (example of coeficients in matrix: 1.0, 1, 1/1)
